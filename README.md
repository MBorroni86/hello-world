Marco's repository

I'm an IT Technician I like to have a contact with my colleagues, I like to help them to do their job as best their can with mine, but I'm not only that!
I love music, during the years I've travelled to see gigs all over the Europe, I love also to read books and take photos with my modest Canon.
